# SPA: Welcome and Reset Application (final-production-test-2025)

## 1. Project Summary

This project delivers a complete, production-ready Single Page Application (SPA) designed to test basic in-memory state management and user interaction using modern vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 styling.

The application starts with a customized greeting and provides two core interaction buttons: one for generating an alert, and one for resetting the application's primary heading back to its default state.

## 2. Features and Checks Passed

| Feature | Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initial State** | ✅ Passed | The greeting immediately displays 'Welcome to My App!'. |
| **Alert Button (#click-me)** | ✅ Passed | Clicking the button triggers a standard JavaScript `alert()`. |
| **Reset Button (#reset-btn)** | ✅ Passed | A new button is present, using `btn-success`. Clicking it changes the greeting back to 'Hello World!'. |
| **Styling** | ✅ Passed | Uses Bootstrap 5 CDN for professional, responsive styling. Buttons use different colors (`btn-info` and `btn-success`). |
| **Dependencies** | ✅ Passed | All external libraries (Bootstrap) are linked via CDN. |

## 3. Setup and Usage

### Setup Instructions

Since this is a single HTML file using CDN dependencies, no build tools or package managers (like npm) are required.

1. **Save:** Save the provided code as `index.html`.
2. **Open:** Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

### Usage Guide

1. **Initial View:** The page loads showing the greeting: **"Welcome to My App!"**
2. **Show Alert:** Click the **"Show Alert" (Blue/Info)** button. This triggers a standard browser alert box.
3. **Reset Greeting:** Click the **"Reset Greeting" (Green/Success)** button. This immediately updates the primary heading text back to: **"Hello World!"**

## 4. Code Explanation

### HTML Structure and Dependencies
The application uses the `<!DOCTYPE html>` standard boilerplate. Bootstrap 5 CSS and JavaScript bundles are included via CDN links in the `<head>` and before the closing `</body>` tag, respectively. The layout utilizes Bootstrap's `container` and `row` classes for centering and responsiveness.

### JavaScript Logic (Embedded)

All logic is encapsulated within a `DOMContentLoaded` listener to ensure that the script only executes after all HTML elements are available in the DOM tree.

1. **Element References:** The script acquires references to the `#greeting` element, `#click-me` button, and `#reset-btn`.
2. **Alert Handler:** The `#click-me` button is bound to an event listener that executes the native `alert()` function.
3. **Reset Handler:** The `#reset-btn` handler targets the `textContent` property of the `#greeting` element and explicitly sets it to the string `'Hello World!'`, successfully managing the application's required state change without relying on external persistence mechanisms.
